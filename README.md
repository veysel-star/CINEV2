# CINEV2

CINEV2 is a clean rewrite. CINEV1 is kept as a read-only reference remote (`cinev1`), frozen at tag `CINEV1_v1.0`.

Goal of CINEV2:
- Keep the proven release discipline (MASTER/PROJECT, SHA256, DELIVERY)
- Replace "fake finalize" with real production steps (renderer integration later)
- Stronger state machine + validation + reproducible packaging
